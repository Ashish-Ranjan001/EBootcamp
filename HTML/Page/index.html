                <h3> What is WebSocket and How It Works</h3><br>
                <p id="para">WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between
                    clients and servers. In this article, we'll explore what WebSocket is and how it works, including
                    its advantages and key components. Join us as we dive into the world of WebSocket and its exciting
                    capabilities.</p><br>
                <h4>What is WebSocket</h4>
                <p id="para">WebSocket is a protocol used to create real-time, bi-directional communication channels in web
                    applications. Unlike traditional HTTP requests which are typically one request followed by one
                    response, WebSocket can establish a persistent connection that allows the server to push data to the
                    client in real-time while also receiving data from the client. Compared to traditional polling or
                    long polling, WebSocket significantly reduces network traffic and latency, improving the efficiency
                    and speed of data transmission. It is particularly useful for developing real-time web applications
                    and online games.

                    What is a WebSocket connection? WebSocket establishes a two-way communication channel between the
                    browser and server, enabling the server to proactively push messages to the browser without the need
                    for the browser to continuously send requests to the server. The principle involves creating a
                    "socket" between the browser and server and transmitting data via a handshake. As the protocol
                    requires support from both the browser and server, it needs to be assessed and handled in the
                    application.</p><br>

                <p id="para">WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol based on TCP introduced with HTML5, known for its
                    compatibility with HTTP, low overhead, and efficient communication. WebSocket establishes a
                    persistent connection between the client and server for real-time bidirectional data transmission.

                    WebSocket's main feature is the establishment of a persistent TCP connection that remains until the
                    client or server initiates a termination request. WebSocket informs the server of the desire to
                    upgrade the protocol from HTTP/1.1 to WebSocket protocol through the Upgrade header information in
                    HTTP/1.1.

                    WebSocket is built on top of the HTTP protocol, and all WebSocket requests are sent through the
                    standard HTTP protocol, which is then recognized as a specific header information Upgrade on the
                    server side. HTTP is essential to WebSocket, as WebSocket uses Sec-WebSocket-Key encryption during
                    the handshake and SHA-1 signature.

                    Once the WebSocket connection is established, the client and server can send binary streams or
                    Unicode strings to each other. All data is masked, with the mask value generated randomly by the
                    server. Before sending the data, it must be masked to prevent malicious tampering by third parties.

                    It is worth noting that WebSocket's communication protocol is based on frames (data packets). A
                    complete data packet can be divided into multiple frames, each of which includes a portion of the
                    data and header information.
